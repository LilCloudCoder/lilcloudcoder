# Hi there, I'm Yogya! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a 11-year-old developer with a passion for building intelligent systems, AI frameworks, and efficient full-stack applications. I love turning wild ideas into working code that does *amazing* things. (written by chatgpt)

## 🚀 About Me

![My Picture](Me.png)

I'm a self-taught programmer who's always curious to learn new technologies and challenge the limits of what's possible on any device—even low-end ones! Whether it’s building a powerful AI assistant, a modular backend system, or experimenting with new data visualizations, I code with heart and soul. (written by chatgpt.)

I spend most of my time:
- Designing and optimizing AI models and logic systems
- Developing with Python (FastAPI, Flask), JavaScript (Node.js)
- Experimenting with web3.py
- Working and fine tuning ollama and hugginfacehub models with modules

## 🧠 My Tech Stack

Here are the core technologies I work with regularly:

### **Languages & Frameworks**
- **Python** – My main language for logic, data, AI, and backend work
- **FastAPI** – Lightweight and powerful backend APIs
- **Flask** – Modular microservice-based web architecture
- **Node.js** – Real-time backend and service scripting
- **HTML/CSS/JS** – Web interfaces and frontend logic
- **Web3.py** – Decentralized apps and smart contract integration

### **Data Science & Visualization**
- **NumPy** – High-performance numerical computation
- **Pandas** – Data analysis and processing at scale
- **Matplotlib** – Custom data plotting and graphics
- **Seaborn** – Clean and professional statistical visualizations
- **scikit-learn** – Machine learning workflows and models

## 📱

I develop everything using **Termux**, pushing the limits of mobile Linux.

Yes, I build everything **from Android**—and yes, it works smoothly.

## 🔧 Modules I Use Daily

Here's a list of the main Python libraries I use and love:

| Module            | Purpose                                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Pandas**        | DataFrames, CSV/JSON reading, wrangling  |
| **Matplotlib**    | Plotting and custom charting              |
| **Seaborn**       | Advanced graphing with themes             |
| **scikit-learn**  | ML models, pipelines, preprocessing (just experiments)      |
| **FastAPI**       | Async backend API design                  |
| **Flask**         | RESTful APIs, microservices               |
| **Web3.py**       | Blockchain interaction, wallet scripting  |
